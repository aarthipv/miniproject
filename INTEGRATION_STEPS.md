# Your Model Integration Steps

## Current Status
Your web application is built and running. Now you need to integrate your trained model files.

## Step 1: Upload Your Model Files
Place these files from your trained model into the `reconstruction_model/` directory:

```
reconstruction_model/
├── config.json
├── model.safetensors  
├── tokenizer_config.json
└── tokenizer.json
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies
The ML dependencies need to be installed. Currently they're missing which is why you see "demo mode" in the logs.

## Step 3: Integration Points in the Code

### Input Processing (Checkpoint 1)
Location: `model_service.py` line 131
- Receives Latin/Cyrillic text from the website
- Logs the input text for debugging

### Model Inference (Checkpoint 2) 
Location: `model_service.py` lines 142-170
- Uses your tokenizer to process the input
- Calls your model.generate() method
- Decodes the output back to text

### Output Display (Checkpoint 3)
Location: `model_service.py` line 171
- Returns reconstructed text to the website
- Gets displayed in the "Reconstructed Text" section

## Step 4: Test Your Integration
After uploading model files, run:
```bash
python test_model_integration.py
```

This will verify:
- Model files are present
- Dependencies are installed
- Your model loads correctly
- Text reconstruction works
- Translation works

## Key Integration Points

### Your Reconstruction Function
The code implements your exact approach:
```python
# From your notebook:
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, padding=True)
device = next(model.parameters()).device
inputs = {key: val.to(device) for key, val in inputs.items()}
output = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=50)
return tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
```

### Your Highlighting Function
Uses your SequenceMatcher approach:
```python
# From your notebook:
matcher = SequenceMatcher(None, damaged.split(), reconstructed.split())
# Highlights insertions and replacements
```

### Your Translation Function
Calls Gemini API with your exact prompt:
```python
# From your notebook:
prompt = f"""You are a Latin language expert. Translate the following Latin with Cyrillic letters into English and just give the final translation not all of the breakdown process:

Latin: {text}

English:"""
```

## What Happens Next
1. Upload your 4 model files to `reconstruction_model/`
2. The system will automatically detect them
3. Your trained model will replace the demo mode
4. The website will use your actual model for reconstruction
5. Results will show: Original → Reconstructed → Highlighted → Translation

## Character Input Fixed
The website now properly handles Latin and Cyrillic characters in the text input area.
